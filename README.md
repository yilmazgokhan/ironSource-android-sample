# ironSource Sample App

## Introduction

The application is a sample project which uses ironSource SDK.

## About ironSource

(From official website) IronSource is the leading in-app advertising platform. The company focuses on developing technologies for app monetization and distribution, with its core products focused on gametech.

## Ad Types
**Banner**
- Banners are rectangular, system-initiated ads that can be either static or animated that are served in a designated area around your live app content.

**Interstitial**
- The ironSource Interstitial is a full-screen ad unit, usually served at natural transition points during the app lifecycle. We support both static and video interstitials. You can also serve interstitials through the ironSource Mediation platform.

**Offerwall**
- The offerwall is an in-app advertising unit that app developers use to monetize their apps. It acts like a mini-store in an app, listing multiple “offers” that users can complete in exchange for receiving an in-app reward.

**Rewarded Video**
- Rewarded (or "reward-based") video ads are full screen video ads that users have the option of watching in full in exchange for in-app rewards.
